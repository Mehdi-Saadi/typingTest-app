(1, 'A young man asked Socrates the secret of success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the river. When the water got up to their neck, Socrates took the young man by surprise and swiftly ducked him into the water. The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue. Socrates pulled the boy\'s head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked him, \"what did you want the most when you were there?\" The boy replied, \"Air\". Socrates said, \"That is the secret of success! When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it!\" There is no other secret.'),
(2, 'A man called his wife at home and said: \"dear, I was asked to go with my boss and few friends to go fishing to Canada. This is a good opportunity for me to get that Promotion I\'ve been wanting, so could you please pack enough Clothes for a week and set out my rod and fishing box, we\'re Leaving From the office & I will swing by the house to pick my things up\", \"Oh! Please pack my new blue silk pajamas.\" The wife thinks this sounds a bit fishy but being the good wife she is, did exactly what her husband asked. The following Weekend he came home a little tired but otherwise looking good. The wife welcomed him home and asked if he caught many fish? He said, \"Yes! Lots of salmon, some Bluegill, and a few Swordfish. But why didn\'t you pack my new blue silk pajamas I asked you to Do?\" The answer of the wife was wonderful. The wife replied, \"I did they\'re in your fishing box...\"'),
(3, 'A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their strength. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died, the other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out, When he got out, the other frogs said, \"Did you not hear us?\" The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time. This story teaches two lessons: 1-There is power of life and death in the tongue, An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. 2-A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill them.'),
(4, 'There was a one-hour interview on CNBC with Warren Buffett, the second-richest man who has donated $31 billion to charity. Here are some very interesting aspects of his life: 1. He bought his first share of stock at age 11, and he now regrets that he started too late! 2. He bought a small farm at age 14 with savings from delivering newspapers. 3. He still lives in the same, small 3-bedroom house in midtown Omaha, that he bought after he got married 50 years ago. He says that he has everything he needs in that house. His house does not have a wall or a fence. 4. He drives his own car everywhere and does not have a driver or security people around him. 5. He never travels by private jet, although he owns the world\'s largest private jet company. 6. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns 63 companies. He writes only one letter each year to the CEOs of these companies, giving them goals for the year. He never holds meetings or calls them on a regular basis. He has given his CEO\'s only two rules. Rule number 1: Do not lose any of your shareholder\'s money. Rule number 2: Do not forget rule number 1. 7. He does not socialize with the high society crowd. His pastime after he gets home is to make himself some popcorn and watch television. 8. Bill Gates, the world\'s richest man, met him for the first time only 5 years ago. Bill Gates did not think he had anything in common with Warren Buffett. So, he had scheduled his meeting only for half hour. But when Gates met him, the meeting lasted for ten hours and Bill Gates became a devotee of Warren Buffett. 9. Warren Buffett does not carry a cell phone, nor has a computer on his desk. His advice to young people: Stay away from credit cards and invest in yourself and remember: A. Money doesn\'t create man, but it is the man who created money. B. Live your life as simple as you are. C. Don\'t do what others say. Just listen to them, but do what makes you feel good. D. Don\'t go on brand name. Wear those things in which you feel comfortable. E. Don\'t waste your money on unnecessary things. Spend on those who really are in need. F. After all, it\'s your life. Why give others the chance to rule your life?'),
(5, 'A lady and a lawyer sit next to each other on a plane. The lawyer asks her to play a game. If he asked her a question that she didn\'t know the answer to, she would have to pay him hive dollars; And every time the lady asked the lawyer a question that he didn\'t know the answer to, the lawyer had to pay the lady 50 dollars. So the lawyer asked the lady his first question, \"What is the distance between the Earth and the nearest star?\" Without a word the lady pays the lawyer five dollars. The lady then asks him, \"What goes up a hill with four legs and down a hill with three?\" The lawyer thinks about it, butt finally gives up and pays the lady 50 dollars! Then he asked her what the answer was, and the lady paid her 5 dollars without delay!!!'),
(6, 'A man took a room in a hotel. There was a computer in his room. So he decided to send an E-mail for his wife. But accidentally the E-mail was sent to a wrong address. Meanwhile... Somewhere in Houston. A widow had just returned from her husband\'s funeral. The widow decided to check her E-mail. expecting condolence messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she fainted. The widow\'s son rushed into the room. found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read: To: My Loving Wife Subject: I\'ve Reached Date: 2 May 2006 I know you\'re surprised to hear from me. They have computers here. and we are allowed to send E-mails to loved ones. I\'ve just reached and have been checked in. I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow! Your loving hubby.'),
(7, 'A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor\'s office. After the check-up, the doctor took the wife aside and said, \"If you don\'t do the following, your husband will surely die.\" 1- \"Each morning, makes him a healthy breakfast and sends him off to work in a good mood.\" 2- \"At lunchtime, make him a warm, nutritious meal and put him in a good from of mind before he goes back to work.\" 3- \"For dinner, make an especially nice meal and don\'t burden him with household chores.\" At home, the husband asked his wife what the doctor had told her. She replied: \"You\'re going to die.\"'),
(8, 'A boy and his father were in a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again. The boy asked, \"What is this, Father?\" The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, \"Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don\'t know what it is.\" While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, an ugly old lady moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened, and the lady walked between them into a small room. The walls closed, and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number, and then the numbers began to light in the revers order. Finally, the walls opened up again and a beautiful girl stepped out. The father said quietly to his son, \"Go get your mother.\"');
