Call your dad at least once a week and just say \"Dad, I love you\". Fathers also appreciate positive thoughts from their kids. That will make his day a great one. For those of you without parents, call the special people in your life. Who have made difference. Just let them know that you are thinking of them, and that their presence in your life has made a great difference. Sit in silence and appreciate the silence around you. Ask the universe to grant other that same great feeling of peace, security and tranquility. Feed the ducks or birds at your local park. We get caught up in our day to day activities and forget the simple joy of something like feeding the birds. Birds always enjoy a fresh piece of bread.",
    "Give some attention to your pet. Do you have a dog or cat? Spend five minutes every day telling your pet that you care and that they are special. Pets like to know that they are special too. Communicate with your kids if you are a parent. It varies with age, but kids need reassurance that you care about them and that you have their best interest in mind. Tell people \"thank you\" when possible. Sometimes there is nothing else to say but \"thank you\". People remember those who say \"thank you\". Donate your time to a noble cause. It doesn't have to be anything out of a movie. It could be something with your local community. If we all pitch in, then all these small acts of kindness will add up together and create big change. Donate your money to noble cause, but with a sense of mindfulness. Don't give money out of guilt. Rather, give because you know that giving some money will make a difference for those who depend upon your generosity.",
    "Practice patience. Today's world is moving very fast sometimes, and patience is the way out of calamity. Just take a deep breath and let the stress go and allow \"mother nature\" to take care of the situation at hand. Listen to the sounds around you. People always appreciate a good listener more than someone who just babbles. Take notes during important conversation and meeting. People will appreciate this in the long run.

There are thousands and thousands of pets at shelters around the country and around the globe waiting to be brought home. Practice cleanliness.

    "Communicate with your creditors. The most important lesson to learn in business is that things don't always go according to plan. So, if you owe money to other, please communicate so that they understand your situation. In this way, real solutions are created. Respect the Earth. This is our home. This is also the home of millions of creatures. If we all respect the Earth, then mankind and all sorts of amazing creatures can live in harmony and peace. Help the poor. There are destitute people across the globe and also in sections of your city that could benefit form your help. Grab a few spare cans of food of some extra clothes and perhaps there is a Salvation Army or Red Cross office already there that will receive your donation. This will make a big difference. Visit the sick. There is nothing worse than being sick and having nobody visit you. If you go to your local hospital, you don't have to go in the room. Just pass by the rooms of the sick and tell them \"hope you feel better\". This is kindness in action.",
    "Just remember that \"words of kindness\" go a long way. Everyone enjoys receiving words of kindness, since all people are facing challenges in some way and those words offer confidence and assurance. In tough times, kindness is a lit candle in darkness. Encourage kids to learn music. Music is more than just memorizing songs. Music is a spiritual journey that shows rhythm, harmony and much more. Music will carry kids far in their lives; it will help them through difficult times and inspire others. Encourage kids to read. Today with all the technology we have, our minds get fragmented. To refocus, encourage your kids and even their friends to read a good book. Offer to buy them a book they want to read. There is nothing like a great book. Smile. This does not mean you are a freak or mentally disturbed. Is there anything wrong with being happy and sharing that happiness? If that is true, then our society is truly in trouble. A smile radiates good energy. Smiling is totally natural too.",
    "Hold the door for someone has their hands full. It's pretty easy. Just hold the door as you see them approaching. They will be truly glad they didn't have to drop their things just to open a door. If someone gives you a nice gift, write a physical thank you letter and put that into the mail. An actual thank you letter on paper means a lot more than just an e-mail, even in today's modern times. If you are having a meal with someone, please turn off your cell phone. Unless you are a doctor on call, it is not polite to eat and still be wired. You owe it to yourself to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the world for a few minutes.",
    "If a baby looks at you, smile back. Babies need to know that people are caring, so show them that you are a caring person. At the supermarket, do not cut people off with your cart. Go slowly and respect the others who are shopping. People have been injured because some people go through the marketplace like they are the only one who is shopping.

Be fair and also understand the day to day trials and tribulations of your students outside the classroom.",
    "Every morning, greet the rising sun and say \"thank you for this day\". The solar deity will definitely be glad to receive such kind words.

In the same way the sun was glad to receive your morning greeting, the moon also will be glad to receive your evening greeting before you go to sleep. Look for ways to save energy. This is an act of kindness toward the environment. Energy should always be used wisely and not wasted. Look for ways to recycle. As you separate recycled items from regular trash, this will help society to reuse certain materials - like glass and cardboard paper. Use less paper in the office. We don't want to end up chopping down the whole Amazon forest because we need paper to print documents. Learn to work with virtual documents - like PDF documents that can be read on your computer and other mobile devices. This is an act of kindness to the environment, just like recycling.",

You will learn a lot about kindness, compassion, and love in this historical text.",
    "Get organized. An organized life allows others to sense order and this is indirectly being kind to others through this approach. Apply the perennial wisdom of Ben Franklin, where possible: \"early to bed, early to rise, makes one both healthy and wise\". Practice mindfulness about diversity. No two people think alike. In this way, better communication between people becomes possible. When you serve others coffee or tea, always ask them how they like their drink. Perhaps they like some cream or milk or sugar or sweetener. Not everyone likes their coffee black, for example. Just keep on smiling, as much as you can. People always enjoy positive energy, especially during difficult times. This is a great universal approach to kindness.",
    "Be grateful. The universe will reciprocate with great kindness. Visualize others with happiness. Visualize others enjoying a sunny day outside.

    "Collaborate with others in your professional arena. You will build new friendships and contacts. This is called professional kindness. Cooperate with others during a crisis moment. This is the only way out of hard times and into better ones. Explore the possibilities before deciding on your path. Kindness is not just sentimental, but it is also practical. You will be doing yourself a favor to do necessary research before embarking on projects, journeys and more. Listen to your elders. Most likely, your elders will have your best interests at heart. They will say things that you don't understand and hence don't value. However, give them the benefit of the doubt. Surely, they are transforming their experiences of loss and pain and suffering into ones of happiness, success, and prosperity for you.",
    "Try to see others as an extension of yourself. We are all in this life experience together. Knowing that we are all connected is practicing universal kindness, for sure. Say \"thank you\" when someone holds the door or elevator for you. Say \"thank you\" to people who go beyond the regular call of duty to help you and serve your interests. Say \"thank you\" to your teachers and instructors who have educated and helped you to reach your professional goals. Say \"thank you\" to your parents and relatives who always wish the very best for you, despite their own troubles. Say \"thank you\" to all friends and colleagues who have looked out for you over the years and who still enjoy your company."
